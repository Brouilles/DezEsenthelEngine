First Compile Esenthel Engine in DX11 Release mode for both 32/64 bits as FBX DLL's rely on the engine.
Then decompress the "lib.7z" file before compiling, because files inside are too big for GitHub to handle.
After compilation succeeds for 32/64 then run "! 1. Deploy.bat".
Optionally close Visual Studio and run "! 2. Clean.bat".
