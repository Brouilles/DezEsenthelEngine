Android Libraries are added into "Editor Data\Code\Android" which are then packed into "Editor.pak" and extracted by the Editor to "_Build_/_Android_" when compiling for Android platform.

Libraries need to be listed in Engine's "CE Editor C++.cpp" file, "Memc<Str> android_libs, jars".

Google Play Services libs were copied from Android SDK in the following way:
1. open "SDK Manager.exe"
2. download "Google Repository" (and not "Google Play Services")
3. go to "AndroidSDK\extras\google\m2repository\com\google\android\gms"
4. extract required libs from *.aar files (they are actually ZIP files and can be opened using WinRar) into "Editor Data\Code\Android"
5. normally an empty "src" folder must be created in each library folder or compilation will fail, however since Git doesn't allow empty folders, they're instead created by Esenthel Editor

After adding all libraries, they need to be "updated" with the console command, that needs to be executed from each library path location:
C:\Progs\AndroidSDK\tools\android update lib-project --path . --target X
where X can be obtained from:
C:\Progs\AndroidSDK\tools\android list targets

Make sure that "project.properties" has the line:
android.library=true
This will force generate "bin/classes.jar" which is required for building. Do not try to move "classes.jar" into "bin/classes.jar" as it would get destroyed, instead it should be copied manually through the editor "Memc<Str> jars"

precompiling can be performed, HOWEVER it actually SLOWS DOWN building of apps when they're built 2nd or more time, so don't do it
C:\Esenthel\Editor\Bin\Android\Ant\bin\ant clean
C:\Esenthel\Editor\Bin\Android\Ant\bin\ant release
